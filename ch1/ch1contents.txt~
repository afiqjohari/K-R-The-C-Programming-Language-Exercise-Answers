K&R - The C programming Language
chapter 2 book exercises: (/bookexercises/)

Exercise 2-1.  Write a program to determine the ranges of char, short, int, and long variables, both signed and unsigned, by printing appropriate values from standard headers and by direct computation.  Harder if you compute them: determine the ranges of the various floating point types.
Progress:
sucessful: -print basic int data type limits from limits.h
to do: -fix code to directly compute limits of basic data types
 -compute and list limits of floating-point types.

Exercise 2-2.  Write a loop equivalent to the for loop above without using && or ||.
Progress:

Exercise 2-3.  Write a function htoi(s), which converts a string of hexadecimal digits (including an optional 0x or 0X) into its equivalent integer value.  The allowable digits are 0 through 9, a through f, and A through F.
Progress:
Finished.
