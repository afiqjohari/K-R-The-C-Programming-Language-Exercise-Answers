These are my answers to the Richie and Kernighan The C Programming Language exercises, and also my project to learn git.  The proposed solutions are arranged by chapter, and each chapter has a .txt file that states the problems along with my progress and notes.  Also included for each chapter are my own exploratory programs inspired by the material.
